# Polymorphism

#   1) Method overloading
#   2) Method overriding

# class Demo:

#     def fm(self, *args):
#         temp = 0
#         for i in args:
#             temp += i

#         print(temp)

# de = Demo()

# de.fm(10, 5, 2, 3)

# class Car1:
#     def move(self):
#         print("Car is moving front")

# class Car2(Car1):
#     def move(self):
#         print("Moving backward")

# car = Car2()

# car.move()
